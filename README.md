# Pomodoro (on Nest Hub or Nest mini)
Automated time management system based on your timetable with Google Smart Device using `pychromecast`

## Quick start

If you have your Google Nest Hub in your room with the same wifi network, let's try this see if it works.
```
import time
import pychromecast

# List chromecasts on the network, but don't connect
services, browser = pychromecast.discovery.discover_chromecasts()
# Shut down discovery
pychromecast.discovery.stop_discovery(browser)

# Discover and connect to chromecasts named Living Room
chromecasts, browser = pychromecast.get_listed_chromecasts(friendly_names=["Bedroom display"])

cast = chromecasts[0]
# Start worker thread and wait for cast device to be ready
cast.wait()

print(cast.status)

mc = cast.media_controller
mc.play_media('http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4', 'video/mp4')
mc.block_until_active()
print(mc.status)

cast.quit_app()
```
